                They sacrifice everything for us and our country. They leave their family, friends, home and all the comfort for securing our comfort. We Indians mostly forget their supreme sacrifice and never try to understand their emotions and feelings. It’s our biggest fault. We should be thankful for everything they do for us. We are not at all that great, we cannot afford to pay the debt of their service and sacrifice!
            </p><br>
            <p>Our great soldiers are the back bone of our country. It’s our moral duty to respect and love them. Remember this- Oh fellow Indians, we are lucky and blessed that we have Indian Army!</p>
